The Australian Government is marking its 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by launching a comprehensive Business Track initiative. This program aims to bolster two-way trade and investment, focusing on key sectors poised for growth as outlined in the "Invested: Australia’s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040."

### Key Activities and Themes
The Business Track will feature several prominent events designed to foster collaboration and address critical priorities:

CEO Forum: This one-day event will gather 100 influential business leaders from Southeast Asia and Australia. Discussions will revolve around the challenges and opportunities of increasing bilateral trade and investment. The forum will include keynote speakers, roundtables, and plenary sessions.

SME Conference: Aimed at boosting Australian SME trade and investment in the region, this conference will explore four key themes: Southeast Asia’s digital transformation, leveraging regional supply chains, the ASEAN consumer economy, and advancements in food futures and agri-tech.

Marketplace: An advisory services walk-through center where trade and investment experts will offer guidance to Australian SMEs interested in entering the Southeast Asian market. Participants will include government agencies, peak industry bodies, and professional services organizations.

Economic Impact
ASEAN is set to become the world's fourth-largest economy by 2040, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 4% from 2022 to 2040. It is currently Australia’s second-largest two-way trading partner, accounting for $178 billion in trade and $290 billion in investment in 2022. The two regions are also part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP), the largest free trade agreement by combined GDP.

Success Stories
Kalinda IT, a 100% Indigenous-owned Australian IT services business, exemplifies successful engagement in the ASEAN market. Awarded the 2022 Supply Nation Indigenous Exporter of the Year, Kalinda IT has partnered with regional entities to deliver advanced digital services. It will contribute to Jakarta's Electronic Road Pricing project, aimed at reducing traffic congestion, while Indonesian firm Teknologi Karya Digital Nusa plans to export electric buses and mopeds to Australia.

Regional Competition Enhancement
Australia has been instrumental in supporting ASEAN nations in implementing competition laws through the Regional Trade for Development Initiative. Since its inception in 2014, all ASEAN member states have established competition agencies, significantly enhancing consumer protection and market efficiency.

By fostering such initiatives, the Australian Government demonstrates its commitment to strengthening economic ties with Southeast Asia, ensuring mutual growth and prosperity.
