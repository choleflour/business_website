1. Product Introduction

With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart switches have emerged. Like smart plugs, smart switches replace traditional light switches, allowing control, scheduling, and energy usage statistics directly from your phone via Bluetooth BLE5.0. Any place in your home with a switch can be upgraded, and when paired with smart bulbs, you can also adjust brightness and color temperature. This is a convenient option for those new to smart homes, making it easy to control usage and achieve energy savings.
