1. Product Introduction

With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart plugs have emerged. Many household appliances have already become smart, allowing scheduled on/off functions that save energy and meet user needs. However, many appliances cannot meet these demands, leading to the emergence of smart plugs. By connecting the plug's Bluetooth BLE5.0 to a handheld device or gateway to access the internet, installation is complete. Smart plugs can serve as intermediaries for ordinary sockets and household appliances, allowing control via mobile apps or smart speaker voice commands to determine whether to power on or off. This mechanism allows even traditional appliances to become smart home devices, making it easy to control usage and achieve energy savings.
