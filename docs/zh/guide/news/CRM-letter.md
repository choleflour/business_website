**YPCloud Unveils Enterprise AI Cloud at Taiwan Expo in Indonesia**

1. **Introduction** Today, we are proud to unveil our latest innovation, the Enterprise AI Cloud, showcased at the Taiwan Expo in Indonesia. This marks a significant milestone in the evolution of cloud computing, particularly in the realm of private cloud.
2. **Overview** As AI adoption continues to rise, enterprises are increasingly turning to private cloud solutions. However, the challenge lies in finding a solution that is both robust and flexible. While public clouds offer scalability, they often lack the security and control that enterprises require. This is where YPCloud steps in with our Ultra AI Cloud.
3. **Four Major Steps** Implementing our Ultra AI Cloud involves four key steps:
    1. **Building Infrastructure**: We use qbix Runner to establish the foundation of your IaaS infrastructure, ensuring optimal computing resources and network connectivity.
    2. **Application Development**: With our Ultra Builder low-code development tool, you can easily create qbix Run apps tailored to your specific needs.
    3. **System Monitoring and Maintenance**: Our Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) provides comprehensive monitoring and maintenance capabilities, ensuring the smooth operation of your system.
    4. **Scalability and Backup**: Leveraging the resources of Azure, GCP, and AWS, you can seamlessly scale your infrastructure or create backup solutions as needed.
4. **System Architecture** Our Ultra AI Cloud is built on a distributed cloud computing platform offering a streamlined and scalable architecture. The use of Ultra Builder makes it incredibly easy to develop both cloud and AI applications, while our built-in IOC provides advanced monitoring and maintenance capabilities, akin to AI Ops.
