However, most cloud companies currently offer public cloud services.&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While enterprise private clouds may be smaller in scale, they present more challenges than public clouds.</p><p>At the Taiwan Pavilion Exhibition in Indonesia in 2024, YPCloud showcased its Ultra AI Cloud, providing enterprise private cloud solutions. The implementation of Ultra AI Cloud involves four major steps:</p><ol><li>Establishing a computational resource network for enterprise IaaS infrastructure using qbix runner.</li><li>Developing qbix run apps applications using the ultra builder low-code development tool.</li><li>Utilizing the intelligent operation center (IOC) for system monitoring and maintenance.</li><li>Leveraging Azure, GCP, and AWS public cloud resources for expansion or backup.</li></ol><p>The architecture of Ultra AI Cloud is based on distributed cloud computing, offering a simple and flexible scalability. Particularly, the use of ultra builder makes it easy to develop cloud and AI applications within the enterprise. The system comes with built-in IOC monitoring and maintenance capabilities, reaching the level of AiOps.</p><p>Founded in 2005, YPCloud is a cloud native Taiwan based cloud company dedicated to Ultranet Computing distributed cloud computing systems. In 2015, it was awarded first place at the Taipei Computex Cloud Expo, making it the only company in the world specializing in private clouds. YPCloud now offers the UltraOne AI Cloud starter package and X10 tenfold personnel training services, making it the best partner for enterprise private clouds.</p><p>Contact: Amber Sun, <a href="mailto:info@ypcloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">info@ypcloud.com</a></p>',8),r=[a];function s(l,c,p,d,u,h){return n(),i("div",null,r)}const g=e(t,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
